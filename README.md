# DEMO WEBSITE FOR PERSONAL PRESENTATION

*This html-css site is aimed to show a personal site with typical browsing and contents.*
*Although there are no real images of me ,all the texts and thoughts shared are born from this guy*
*Under "My Art" section you can find part of my demo reel project born form my VFX genomic side*
*Hope you enjoy!*

### Deployment

Just copy and paste the full folder structure inside your */public* hosting server hard drive / ftp folder and it will run!

### HTML Notes üìã

I've tried to keep as clean as possible the basic elements.
<Header> (with <Nav> of course) plus <footer> sections have been shared through all the html pages.
<Header> section has been sticked up to better allow browsing/scrolling for better UX.
Width for the content <screen-size> has been setup to 800 px.


### CSS Notes üìã

Althought the design is ready to use a *Custom Colour Palette* I've finally not used to keep the design under the black/white stile.
I've divided the CSS code in sections and I've followed the same procedure as in HTML;
-General rule style for resetting the browser
-Specific style rules to format *Shared sections like; header and footer*
-Specific styles for each *Main* section within each page.

This way the code becomes more clean and it's easier to brownse while editing in Visual Studio.
